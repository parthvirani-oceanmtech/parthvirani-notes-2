# Using `build_runner` in watch mode

Did you know that you can run build_runner in "watch" mode?

This will start a persistent build server that watches the file system for edits and rebuilds as necessary.

Works great with hot-reload as the server will re-generate the required files on save. 🔥

It's right there on the usage instructions for the package: 😅
