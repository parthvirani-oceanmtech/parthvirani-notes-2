# Adding a Custom Test timeout

Did you know?

When writing tests in Flutter, you can add a custom timeout argument.

This is very useful for tests that can potentially hang (when waiting on an asynchronous stream matcher). ðŸ‘‡

If you have many tests running on CI, this can save you a lot of time and money! ðŸ’°

You know what else is cool?

Custom timeouts can be configured per-file, per-test, or per-group, just like this. ðŸ‘‡
