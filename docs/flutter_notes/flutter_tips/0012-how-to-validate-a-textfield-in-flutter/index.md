# How to Validate a TextField in Flutter

How do you validate a `TextField` **as the user types** in Flutter?

Let's figure it out. üßµ

(hint: we'll use an `AnimatedBuilder`)

---

Let's start with a `StatefulWidget` that contains a `TextField` and an `ElevatedButton`.

This just shows the UI but doesn't do any validation.

Next, let's create a `TextEditingController`, dispose it as needed, and pass it to the `TextField`.

---

To validate the text, we can add:

- an `errorText` getter variable
- pass it to the `TextField`
- use it to enable/disable our button with some conditional logic

---

But if we try this now, both the `TextField` error hint and the button UI don't update as the text changes.

Why? üßê

---

We forgot to tell Flutter to rebuild our widget when the text changes!

This *could* be fixed by setting a local state variable with a call to `setState()` in the `TextField` `onChanged` callback.

---

But we don't even need a local state variable in the first place because `TextEditingController` already contains the text value.

So how can we rebuild the widget when the text value changes?

---

We can wrap our widgets with an `AnimatedBuilder` and pass our `TextEditingController` to the animation argument:

---

This works because `AnimatedBuilder` takes an animation argument of type `Listenable`.

And `TextEditingController` extends `ValueNotifier`, which extends `ChangeNotifier`, which implements `Listenable`.

Here's how these classes are implemented in the Flutter SDK:

---

This means that we can pass instances of any of these classes to `AnimatedBuilder`.

And we can now validate our text on the fly:

I have just written an article that covers all these details and includes all the source code.
