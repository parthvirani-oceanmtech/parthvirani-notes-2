# Flutter Riverpod: How to Register a Listener during App Startup

How do you register a listener as soon as your Flutter app starts?

It's tempting to add the listener callback inside the main method directly.

But that's not a good idea.

Let's figure out a better approach using Riverpod, while keeping our app startup logic neat and tidy. 🧵

First of all, let's create a StreamProvider that we can use to access the input stream. 👇

This way we can hide away the singleton and get:

- better separation of concerns
- more testable code

Next, we can create a separate service class that:

- registers a listener (via `ref.listen`)
- handles all incoming stream events inside a callback

Note that since we have a Ref object, we can access other dependencies if needed. 👇

We also need to create a provider for our new service class.

This is easy as we just need to pass `ref` as a constructor argument. 👇

But doing this alone won't create the `DynamicLinksService` until we access/read it somewhere! ⚠️

To address this, we can get back to the main method and:

- Create a `ProviderContainer`
- Use it to read our service class provider
- Replace `ProviderScope` with `UncontrolledProviderScope`

And voila!  🏁

Our call to `container.read()` will ensure that our service class is initialized, and the listener is registered as soon as the app starts.

This approach is scalable too, as we can register/initialize new services with one line of code. 👇

That's it! You now have another valuable tool for your developer black belt! 🥋
