# Dart 2.17: Enhanced Enums with Members

Did you know?

Since Dart 2.17, you can declare enums with members. ðŸš€

See below for another example. ðŸ‘‡

What else can you do with this?

- Define multiple properties
- Add named or positional arguments to the constructor (as long as it's a `const` constructor)
- Define custom methods and getters
