# Add a part file with Riverpod Snippets

If you use code generation in Dart, you have to add a `part` directive to your files.

But you don't need to write everything by hand.

Instead, you can type just a few letters and let the Riverpod Snippets extension infer the correct file name.

Nice little time-saver. ðŸ™‚
