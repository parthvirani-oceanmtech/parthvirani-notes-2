# The HtmlUnescape package

Ever worked with a REST API that returns a bunch of escaped Strings?

Use the HtmlUnescape package to convert them before you show them in the UI. ðŸ‘‡

```dart
import 'package:html_unescape/html_unescape.dart';

const unescaped = 'She said: &quot;Look at that kitten!&quot;';
final unescape = HtmlUnescape();
final escaped = unescape.convert(unescaped);
print(escaped); // She said: "Look at that kitten!"
```
