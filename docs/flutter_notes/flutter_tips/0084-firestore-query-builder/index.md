# Using the query builder UI in Cloud Firestore

Did you know that Cloud Firestore has a query builder UI? ðŸ”¥

You can apply this to a collection or collection group and:

- filter results (using where)
- order by one or more fields
- limit the number of results

It's a nice little addition. ðŸ‘Œ
