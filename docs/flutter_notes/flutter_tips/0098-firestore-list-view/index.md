# Pagination with FirestoreListView

Ever wanted to support pagination when loading a collection of documents from Firestore?

The "firebase_ui_firestore" package makes it super-easy!

Just add it to your project and use the FirestoreListView widget whenever you need pagination.

It's that simple! ðŸš€

And if you need more control, you can specify additional arguments:

- emptyBuilder
- errorBuilder
- loadingBuilder

And you know what's cool?

If the data changes on the backend, the UI will automatically rebuild. ðŸš€
