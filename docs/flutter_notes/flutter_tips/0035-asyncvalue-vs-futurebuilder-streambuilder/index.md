# `AsyncValue` vs `FutureBuilder` & `StreamBuilder`

If you've been using Flutter for some time, you'll know that `FutureBuilder` & `StreamBuilder` help you deal with asynchronous data in your UI.

But working with `AsyncSnapshot` is quite tricky, and the AsyncValue class from the Riverpod package makes life much easier.

A thread. ðŸ§µ

Let's take a peek at the definition of AsyncSnapshot.

This is a class that defines four properties:

- `connectionState`
- `data`
- `error`
- `stackTrace`

These properties are all **independent** from each other.

But what we really want are three **mutually exclusive** states:

- data
- loading
- error

And that's exactly what AsyncValue gives us, by defining them with some factory constructors:

On top of that, we also get an AsyncValueX extension with a "when" method that we can use to map all possible states to our UI.

This technique is called **pattern matching**, and means that we don't need to rely on if/else clauses like we do when working with AsyncSnapshot.

Time to put things together.

You can create a `StreamProvider` that returns any method or function that returns a stream with a matching type.

Then you can declare a `ConsumerWidget` and **watch** the provider, ensuring that the widget will rebuild whenever there's a new value.

That's all. You can now say bye-bye to all your `StreamBuilder`s and `FutureBuilder`s, and use `StreamProvider` & `FutureProvider` with `AsyncValue` instead.

I have covered state management with Riverpod in great detail in my new Flutter course:
