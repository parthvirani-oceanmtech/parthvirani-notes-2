# Are global variables bad?

Are global variables bad?

Well, it depends.

In my projects, I often create global variables such as const widgets or Riverpod providers, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that!

But global MUTABLE state IS dangerous (hard to know who changed it and which widgets should rebuild).
