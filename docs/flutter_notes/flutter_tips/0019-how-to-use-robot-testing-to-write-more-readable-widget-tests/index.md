# How to use Robot Testing to write more readable widget tests

Would you like your widget tests to be **readable**?

Just create a Robot class that defines each step as a method.

How is this implemented? Let's take a look. ðŸ§µ

Our Robot class should take the WidgetTester as an argument.

Then we can define a convenience method that pumps the root widget and sets all the mocks we need (we use Riverpod in this example):

Then, we can define each testing step as a separate **atomic** method.

Inside it, we can use the finder and tester as usual:

We can also write expectations as methods inside the `Robot` class:

The net result?

We can write widget tests with a human-readable syntax. ðŸŽ‰

And because each testing step is defined inside the `Robot` class, autocomplete makes our life easier. ðŸš€

I first discovered this technique in this article by [@jcocaramos](https://twitter.com/jcocaramos) at [@VGVentures](https://twitter.com/VGVentures):

- [Robot Testing: Code written by engineers and readable by well, everyone](https://verygood.ventures/blog/robot-testing-in-flutter)

And I have added some modifications to make it usable with both widget and integration tests.
