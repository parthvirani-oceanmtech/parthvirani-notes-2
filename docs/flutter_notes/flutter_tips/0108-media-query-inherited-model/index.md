# MediaQuery as InheritedModel

Did you know?

When you call `MediaQuery.of(context)` inside a build method, the widget will rebuild when *any* of the `MediaQuery` properties change.

But there's a better way that lets you depend only on the properties you care about (and minimize unnecessary rebuilds). ðŸ‘‡
