# Got linter issues? Use `dart fix --apply`

Ever tried to update an old Flutter project to the latest APIs and got a ton of linter issues? ðŸ˜­

For example, all the default text styles have been renamed in Flutter 3.7. ðŸ™„

In cases like this, just run `dart fix --apply`. ðŸš€

And you're good to go! ðŸ‘Œ
