# Golden Image Testing with Robot Testing

This may not look like much, but getting the image below to be generated by a Golden Image Test was a challenge!

I've managed to do all this by piecing out information from various StackOverflow and GitHub issues, without using any 3rd party packages. ðŸ’ª

How does it work? ðŸ§µ

Believe it or not, all these steps need to be done programmatically:

- loading a custom font (Roboto)
- loading the material icons as a font
- precaching all image assets

That's because widget tests (which golden tests are based on) won't do any of this by default.

It may be a bit too much to fit all this in a thread, so I'll probably write an article instead.

And I'll also cover all the findings in my Flutter course, which already includes many in-depth lessons about automated testing! ðŸ‘‡
