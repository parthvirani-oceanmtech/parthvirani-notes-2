# Exception handling: try/catch vs Result

If we want to write robust apps, handling exceptions is important.

And in Flutter, this is normally done with `try`/`catch` blocks.

As an alternative, we can use the Result type to declare errors **explicitly** in the function **signature**.

So let's learn about the pros & cons. ðŸ§µ

As a starting point, let's consider a function that handles exceptions with `try` and `catch`:

- The return type is a `Future<Location>`
- If the request succeeds, we return a `Location` object
- If the request fails, we throw an exception

![](062.2-throw.png)

---

When we call our function, we can use await (since it returns a `Future`).

And we should also catch any exceptions it might throw.

But if we forget the `try`/`catch` block, the compiler won't warn us.

And this opens the door to unhandled exceptions in our code.

---

In addition to this, the function **signature** doesn't make it **explicit** that it can throw an exception.

And we can only find out if the function throws by reading its documentation and/or implementation.

---

So how can we make it explicit that the function can return an error?

What we need is a `Result` type that can represent **either** a success or an error.

The Swift language supports this using enums with **associated values**.

But this feature is not available in the Dart language.

If we want to implement a `Result` type in Dart, we have two options:

- Build our own using abstract classes and subclassing (the hard way)
- Use a package such as [multiple_result](https://pub.dev/packages/multiple_result), [dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz), or [fpdart](https://pub.dev/packages/fpdart) (easier)

---

So let's convert our geolocation function to use `Result` from the [multiple_result](https://pub.dev/packages/multiple_result) package.

Here's what's changed: 

- The return type is a `Future<Result>`
- If the request succeeds, we return a `Success` object
- If the request fails, we return an `Error`

When we call our function, we can use `await` to get the result.

And then we can use **pattern matching** to handle both success and error cases with the `when()` method.

This way we can't make mistakes, since it's a compiler error to not handle the error case.

---

Here's what we've learned so far:

- The `Result` type lets us **explicitly** declare success and error types in the **signature** of a function
- We can use pattern matching in the calling code to ensure we handle both cases **explicitly**

But should we really use `Result` everywhere?

![](062.8-empty.png)

---

Not so fast.

Here's an example where we need to call multiple async methods **sequentially**.

If any of these methods throws an exception, we can catch it in **one** place and handle it as needed.

![](062.9-pattern-matching.png)

---

But if we attempt to implement the same method using `Result`, we're in trouble.

The code becomes much harder to read, because we have to **unwrap** each `Result` object manually.

And we have to write a lot of control flow logic to handle all the success/error cases.

![](062.10-place-order-result.png)

---

So is the `Result` type pointless and should we use old good `try`/`catch` blocks everywhere?

Or is it worthwhile in some cases?

How can we decide when to use it, and when not to?
