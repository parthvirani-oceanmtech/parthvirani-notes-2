# [core/duplicate-app] A Firebase App named "[DEFAULT]" already exists

Have you ever encountered this error when running your Flutter app on iOS or macOS?

```
[core/duplicate-app] A Firebase App named "[DEFAULT]" already exists
```

The first time it happened to me, it took me hours to figure it out. ðŸ˜¤

But as it turns out, there's an easy solution. ðŸ‘‡

First of all, just know that this issue is showing up quite a bit on StackOverflow and GitHub.

There are multiple reasons you may encounter it.

But none of the solutions I found online worked for me:

Here's what went wrong in my case.

I had two separate Firebase projects using *THE SAME* iOS (or macOS) bundle ID.

As a result, the Dart initialization code couldn't decide which Firebase project to use.

FYI, here's where to find the iOS bundle ID. ðŸ‘‡

If you find yourself in the same situation, the easiest solution is to specify a "name" parameter when calling `Firebase.initializeApp()`.

And give it the Firebase project ID as an argument. ðŸ‘‡

Once again, this will solve the problem if you have two or more Firebase projects using *THE SAME* iOS (or macOS) bundle ID.

But it's not the only reason you may get this error.

I just wanted to share this as it may save you a few hours of frustration. ðŸ¥²
