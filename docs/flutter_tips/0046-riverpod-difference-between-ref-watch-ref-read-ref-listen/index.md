# Riverpod: difference between `ref.watch`, `ref.read`, `ref.listen`

When using Riverpod, what is the difference between `ref.watch()`, `ref.read()` and `ref.listen()`?

It really boils down to this. ðŸ‘‡

For more details, here's a thread. ðŸ§µ

For example, suppose you have a logout button which behaves like this:

- When pressed, call a method to sign out
- While sign out is in progress, disable the button
- If an error occurs, show a SnackBar

As a starting point, we can create our button as a `ConsumerWidget`:

Next up, we can create a `StateNotifier` subclass for our button, along with the corresponding provider.

Note the use of `AsyncValue.guard()`. This can be used as a lightweight alternative to `try`/`catch` as explained here:

Next, let's use the notifier in our widget:

- in the `build()` method, we can call `ref.watch()` to watch the provider's state and disable our button if it's "loading"
- inside the callback, we use `ref.read()` so we can call methods in our notifier

What about errors?

We can use `ref.listen()` to trigger a callback every time the state changes.

Inside it, we can check the previous and current state show a `SnackBar` on error.

Note: As of Riverpod 2.0, you'll also want to check `state.isRefreshing`:

Lastly, note how we now have a good separation of concerns:

- our `StateNotifier` manages the widget state and calls the `signOut` method in the auth repository 
- our widget watches state changes and shows the UI

This makes our code more testable and maintainable in the long run.

Btw, my Flutter course already includes 2.5 hours of content about Riverpod, with more planned:
