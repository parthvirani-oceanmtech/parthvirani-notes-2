# Testing functions that throw

When writing test expectations for functions that throw, we need a bit careful.

If we call the function directly, the test will fail as it won't catch the exception as we expect.

In these cases, we should always pass a closure when calling the `expect` method as shown here. üëá

Here's a comparison I made to explain why calling the method directly won't work.

These two implementations are equivalent. And they both fail because the function will execute and throw *before* `expect()` is even called. üëá

Hope this will save you some headaches. üëç
