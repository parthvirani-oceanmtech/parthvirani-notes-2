# Using `context.mounted` in Flutter 3.7

Up until recently, it wasn't possible to check if a `StatelessWidget` was mounted in Flutter.

But since Flutter 3.7, `BuildContext` itself has a `mounted` property! ðŸŽ‰

This makes it easy to check if **any** widget is mounted.

That's a great quality-of-life improvement. ðŸ‘Œ
