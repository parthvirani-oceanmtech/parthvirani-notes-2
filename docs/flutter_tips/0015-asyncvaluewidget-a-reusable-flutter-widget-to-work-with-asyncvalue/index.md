# `AsyncValueWidget`: a reusable Flutter widget to work with `AsyncValue` (using Riverpod)

Compared to the built-in `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` Flutter widgets, working with `AsyncValue` in Riverpod is a breeze:

All this magic is possible because the `when` method gives us a convenient **pattern matching** API, and we can use it to map our data to the UI. 

But there's more. ðŸ§µ

As you build your apps, you're likely to have different "data" widgets for different async APIs:

But the loading and error UI are often the same.

And it would be quite repetitive to copy-paste them every time you need a new "async" widget.

A better option is to define an `AsyncValueWidget` that takes care of the **loading** and **error** states, and let us customise the UI for the **data** state.

This is easy to implement:

With this in place, we can rewrite our `ProductScreen` like this.

Much cleaner.

What about slivers? 

The `AsyncValueWidget` class works well for regular widgets. But sometimes you have complex view hierarchies that use slivers.

And if you're not careful, you may end up with errors like this:

Well, let's get this sorted by creating an `AsyncValueSliverWidget`:
