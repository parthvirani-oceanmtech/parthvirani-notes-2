# How to use the new Riverpod Generator package

Declaring providers by hand using Riverpod can be tricky.

And the syntax for passing arguments to a provider is quite limited.

What if we could simply declare functions and classes, and let build_runner generate all the providers on the fly?

Enter Riverpod Generator. ðŸ‘‡

As an example, consider the syntax you'd use to create a `FutureProvider`.

If you need to pass an argument, you have to:

- use the family modifier
- add a second type annotation
- pass the extra argument

All the types must match, and your code won't compile if you get it wrong.

With the new Riverpod Generator, this is much easier:

- just declare a function with the desired return type and annotate it
- match the function name with the type of the ref argument (`movie` â†’ `MovieRef`)
- pass one or more arguments and use them in the function body

Note that for everything to work, you also need to:

- import riverpod_annotation.dart
- declare a part file that will contain the generated code

And once everything is ready, run this command:

```
dart run build_runner watch
```

And the `.g.dart` file will be generated (and updated) any time you save your changes.

I've covered the new Riverpod Generator in great detail on this article.

This explains how to use it with different kinds of providers, and covers some limitations and tradeoffs. ðŸ‘‡

I'll also cover Riverpod Generator and the new Riverpod 2.0 APIs in my Flutter Foundations course.

In fact, I'm planning a whole new module about it, that will be out next week.
