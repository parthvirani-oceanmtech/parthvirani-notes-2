# How to write a reactive in-memory store with RxDart

Ever needed to create a **reactive** in-memory store for simple values?

To help with that, I created a simple wrapper class around `BehaviorSubject` (from the RxDart package).

Here's a (short) thread explaining how to use it. ðŸ§µ

In this example, we have a "fake" cart repository with async calls for reading and writing data.

This is useful when you don't have a backend (yet), but need something that the rest of the app can use.

As a bonus, it's easy to simulate delays, errors, etc.

Once you have this, the rest of the app can use the new Future and Stream-based APIs in the repository.

And later on, you can swap the "fake" repository for a real one (or even keep both for testing/production).

This is covered in more detail here:

Aside from `BehaviorSubject`, the RxDart package has many useful APIs for manipulating and combining streams.

You can learn more about it here:

Hope you found this useful.
