# VSCode extensions to speed-up your Flutter workflow

What are some VSCode extensions you can use to speed-up your Flutter workflow?

Here's a thread with my favourites! ðŸ§µ

When creating model classes, you'll often needs methods such as:

 - copyWith()
 - toString()
 - toJson()
 - fromJson()
 - toMap()
 - fromMap()
 - == operator
 - hashCode

Use the Dart data class generator to create them all in one go!

If you use Riverpod, you'll quickly get tired of typing out all your providers and consumers by hand.

The Flutter Riverpod Snippets extension makes this a lot easier!

Do you want to know if you make mistakes as you type?

The Error Lens extension improves the highlighting of errors, warnings, and other language diagnostics, and I find it immensely helpful.

Better Comments helps you improve your code comments by highlighting alerts, notes, TODOs, and more.

The Advanced New File extension lets you create files anywhere in your workspace, using your keyboard only.

(and we all know that every time we touch the mouse a cute animal suffers, right?)

Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know about GitHub Copilot.

It's an AI pair programmer which suggests line completions and entire function bodies as you type.

(it even helps me write documentation and marketing copy! ðŸ¤¯)

Of course, you're free to choose whichever theme you like best.

Though this Official Dracula theme is my favorite.

There are many other useful VSCode extensions.

But these are the ones I use all the time. ðŸ‘Œ

Happy coding!
