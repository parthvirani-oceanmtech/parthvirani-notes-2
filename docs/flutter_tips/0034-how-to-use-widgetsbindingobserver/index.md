# How to use `WidgetsBindingObserver`

`WidgetsBindingObserver` is very handy for listening to changes to:

- routing events
- device orientation
- platform settings (text scale factor, brightness, locale, etc.)
- app lifecycle events

Here's how to use it to hide sensitive info when the app goes to the background. ðŸ§µ

How to set it up?

- add the `WidgetsBindingObserver` **mixin** to one of your classes (generally a `State` subclass)
- register the observer inside `initState` (and dispose it when done)

Then, just override the methods for the changes you want to keep track of.

In this case, we listen to app lifecycle changes and update a "foreground" flag via `setState()`.

One useful application of this is to build a custom widget that hides sensitive user data any time the app is backgrounded.

This can be hooked up to the `builder` argument of `MaterialApp`.

That's it! You can now test this and check the logs when you background & foreground the app.
